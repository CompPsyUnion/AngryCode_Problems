
## Background and Problem description

The cat living next to DB, always a fan of shiny objects(Baling~ Baling~), has taken up a hobby of mining diamonds in her spare time!  She has collected $N$ diamonds ($N \leq 50,000$) of varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in **a pair of**  display cases in her cattery.


Since she wants the diamonds in each of the two cases to be relatively similar in  size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the same case if their sizes differ by more than $K$ (two diamonds can be displayed together in the same case if their sizes differ by exactly $K$).  Given $K$, please help her determine the maximum number of diamonds she can display in both cases together.


## Input format

The first line of the input file contains $N$ and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq 1,000,000,000$).

The next $N$ lines each contain an integer giving the size of one of the

diamonds.  All sizes will be positive and will not exceed $1,000,000,000$.

## Output format

Output a single positive integer, telling the maximum number of diamonds that

**She can showcase in total in both the cases.**
